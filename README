Test your own push_swap... A project for 42 school...



Git clone this in the root of your push_swap project or edit the path variable in the script...

Or just copy/paste this :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/busshi/push_swap_checker.git && cd push_swap_checker && /bin/bash grademe.sh
```


Checker usage:
```bash
/bin/bash push_swap_checker.sh [Numbers of random numbers] [Numbers of tests to run] [-r]
```

Option -r for reverse sort (bonus)

You can edit grademe.sh to change the number of tests to run...



Grademe usage:
```bash
./grademe.sh # run all evaluations tests with 1 to 5 numbers, 100 numbers and 500 numbers

./grademe.sh fast # decrease the number of tests
```
